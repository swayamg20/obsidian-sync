Idea1:

two things:
1. an sdk to build mcps with very simple ease.
    - the OAuth, token taking, MCPs context, memory
    - user can add loggings to their existing MCP setups (connect to our dashboard)
2. A Dashboard:
    - user can also add monitoring on MCP tools
    - user can create new MCPs also
    - user can publish their MCPs with our OAuth flow


Refinement 1:
developer -> 
1. would be able to create an MCP tool
2. would be able to add orchestration of MCP servers / tools
3. would be able to use memory caching (redis type soln)
4. would be able to deploy their MCP server on our platform
5. would be able to implement OAuth using our auth and the tool's 3rd party auth
6. would be able to monitor their MCP's usage
7. would be able to easily make changes in the orchestration layer

Refinement2:
[[2025-09-09]]
1. I don't think that we need to build mcp developemtn sdk
2. instead I can focus on: building MCPs with AI / mcp observability
